Computer-assisted proof in Hill's equations

In the folder "scripts" there are Newton's interval method, bisection interval method and Krawczyk method for different cases of the Mathieu equation. The C++ code uses the library CAPD::DynSys for rigorous numerics.

In the folder enclosures there are the data enclosures for the different results of the Hill's equation.
